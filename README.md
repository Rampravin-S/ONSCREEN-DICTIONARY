# ONSCREEN-DICTIONARY(for windows)
This python overlay helps the user to search any word's meaning as soon as the word is copied!
The urge for having an on-screen dictionary which could help me find meaning for those words seemed alien to me!Thats when i came up with this idea. This is just the first step,
here i have used a free api from which the meaning of words are accessed.As this is the initial stages the code yields only a overlay using Tkinter library.
In future i would be pleased to add ocr(optical character regonition) so that readers could make use of this in their pdf too.Also i would be pleased to see myself building this into something more than just an overlay.
The user may need to download the following library before running the code in your vscode:
#pyperclip
#requests
(for those who dont know: TO INSTALL LIBRARY use pip install <library_name>)
By executing the above you can finally run the python code and enjoy reading.
